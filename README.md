# Usernaut

Usernaut is an Operator that manages user accounts and teams across
various SaaS platforms, leveraging Kubernetes for orchestration and management.

## Description

Usernaut is designed to simplify the management of user accounts and teams across multiple SaaS platforms by leveraging Kubernetes as the underlying orchestration engine. It provides a unified interface for creating, updating, and deleting user accounts and teams, ensuring consistency and compliance across different services.
Usernaut uses Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to define user accounts and teams, allowing users to manage these resources declaratively. The operator watches for changes in the CRDs and applies the necessary actions to the underlying SaaS platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- go version v1.24.2+
- operator sdk version v1.39.2+

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/usernaut:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/usernaut:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
> privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

> **NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall

**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/usernaut:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

1. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/usernaut/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```
